Description: 
            lsclib is a python-based repository hosted on GitHub that employs the 
            Monte Carlo ray-tracing method of radiative transport to effectively model
            LSCs. lsclib hopes to short-circuit the learning curve associated with
            breaking into the field, and present results in both an academic and 
            commercial context. This repository will continue to become more 
            sophisticated, but for now relies heavily upon the paper submitted for 
            publishing entitled "An open-source Monte Carlo ray-trace simulation tool 
            for luminescent solar concentrators with validation studies employing
            scattering phosphor films."
